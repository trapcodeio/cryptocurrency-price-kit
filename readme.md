# Cryptocurrency Price Kit 
###### STAGE: `DEVELOPMENT`
The best price kit you need when working with cryptocurrencies with multiple useProviders support.

## Goal
 - To provide a simple and easy to use API for working with cryptocurrency prices.
 - To provide a simple API to support multiple data useProviders
 - To provide useCache support and interval data fetching.
 - To support as many providers as possible.


## Easy As

```typescript
import {Cpk} from 'cryptocurrency-price-kit';
import Livecoinwatch from "cryptocurrency-price-kit/providers/livecoinwatch.com";

Cpk.useProviders([
    Livecoinwatch({apiKey: 'your-api-key'})
])

// Initialize with config
const cpk = new Cpk('livecoinwatch.com');

// Get bitcoin Price and useCache for 60 secs
const price = await cpk.get('BTC/USD', 60);

console.log(price) // The current price of bitcoin in USD

// OR
// GET Many Prices and useCache for 60 secs
const prices = await cpk.getMany(['BTC/USD', 'ETH/USD'], 60);
```

### What you should know.
- Default currency is `USD`
- `cache` is enabled by default
- If currency is not defined, it will be `USD`
- Error is thrown if request is not successful, so you should catch all requests.

### Supported providers

- [livecoinwatch.com](https://livecoinwatch.com)
- [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info)
- [coingecko.com](https://coingecko.com)
- [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com)

#### Adding custom provider
This can be achieved in two alwaysStrict

- Create an issue on GitHub requesting a certain provider, and we will try to add it. (`Try` if the provider documentation is clear we add it)
- See how to create it yourself: [How to create a custom provider](#how-to-create-a-custom-provider)

### What may come in the future.
- Command line support: E.g. `npx cpk update-supported-data` should update the providers supported coins and currency array. 
      This is considered important because the majority of the providers have an endpoint where your can get the coins and currency they support.
      <br> if supported coins and currency are updated frequently, it will reduce the amount of error requests that may cost you depending on your provider.



### How to create a custom provider
Creating a custom provider is as easy as.

```typescript
import {defineCpkProvider} from "cryptocurrency-price-kit/src/provider";
const CustomProvider = defineCpkProvider({
    name: 'provider-domain.com',
    coinsSupported: ['BTC', 'ETH'] || "any", // if any no validation is done
    currenciesSupported: ['USD', 'EUR'] || "any", // if any no validation is done
    
    // This is the function that will be called to get the price
    // It will be called with the coin and currency as arguments
    // The async function should return the price
    async getPrice(coin, currency) {
        // return the price
        return 0;
    },
    
    // This is the function that will be called to get multiple prices
    // It will be called with array of coins and currency as arguments
    // The async function should return the prices as object
    // The object should have the coin/key and the price as value
    // E.g. {"BTC/USD": 0, "ETH/EUR": 0}
    async getPrices(pairs) {
        // return the prices
        for (const pair of pairs) {
            // pair.coin, pair.currency
        }
        return {};
    }
})
```
That's all üòÅ, all cache function is handled by the package, so you don't need to worry about it.
Only return the values, and we will handle the rest.
